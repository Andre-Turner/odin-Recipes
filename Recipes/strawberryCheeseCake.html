        <li>3/8 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 2/3 tbsp Vanilla</li>

        <li>6 tbsp Butter, unsalted</li>
        <li>32 oz Cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup Sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
       <li>Move the oven rack to the lower third position and heat the oven to 350°F. Wrap the outer bottom of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with aluminum foil. </li>
       <li>Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 2-inches up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool while you make the filling.</li>
       <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF.</li>
       <li>In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. </li>
       <li>Add the sugar and sour cream, beat until well combined. Add the vanilla and salt, beat on low speed until smooth. </li>
       <li>Using a silicone spatula, gently stir in the eggs just until combined. Pour the batter over the prepared crust.</li> 
       <li>Fill a roasting pan with a few inches of boiling water and place the cheesecake in the center. </li>
       <li>Bake for 1 hour, OR until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Turn the oven off, leave the cheesecake in the water bath in the oven for another hour. </li>
       <li>Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and place it on a wire rack. Run a small knife around the outer edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the pan and leave it to cool at room temperature for about 1 ½ hours. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the sides of the pan And transfer the cheesecake to a serving platter.</li>
       <li>Add the diced strawberries and cornstarch to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add the sugar.</li>
       <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
       <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, salt, and chopped strawberries. Set aside to cool for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
       <li>Spread the topping evenly over the cheesecake or over individual slices just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
