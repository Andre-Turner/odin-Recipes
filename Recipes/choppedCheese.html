    <h1>New York City's Finest Sandwich</h1>

    <p>New York City's Chopped Cheese Sandwich with chopped beef burgers, melted gooey cheese, caramelized onions, topped with tomatoes and shredded lettuces, and hugged by a toasted hero roll. This is the classic way to make the iconic NYC chopped cheese. It reminds me of Philly cheesesteak, but even better!</p>
